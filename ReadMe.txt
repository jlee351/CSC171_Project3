Made original game involving collision, life system, score, animations, and physics mechanics.
Inspired by popular game Brick Break

The user hits the ball in order to break blocks.

The user gets 1 points for each block.

The blocks move sideways making it harder for users to hit the ball.

User gets three "lives", or balls.


ERRORS

The blocks do not bounce off the blocks sideways.

The blocks do not break (disappear). I have attempted to take the hit block out of the array of blocks - didn't work.
